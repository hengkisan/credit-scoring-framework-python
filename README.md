# 🧮 Credit Scoring Framework in Python

A **modular and automated Python framework** for credit scoring model development — including data preprocessing, optimal monotonic binning, Weight of Evidence (WoE) transformation, logistic regression training, and interpretable scorecard generation.

This repository provides a **ready-to-use foundation** for building, validating, and deploying explainable credit scoring systems.
